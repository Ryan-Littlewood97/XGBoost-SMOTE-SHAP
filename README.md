# XGBoost-SMOTE-SHAP
Training an XGBoost model and then doing an analysis using both SMOTE and SHAP within the model. This analysis will use the Cervical Cancer dataset from the 
UCI Machine learning repositroy. An XGBoost model will be trained, but there will be class imbalances that are dealt with, and also SHAP will be used to visually explain
the model.
